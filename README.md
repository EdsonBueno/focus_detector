# focus_detector
Wrapper around Google's [VisibilityDetector](https://github.com/google/flutter.widgets/tree/master/packages/visibility_detector) for combining it with Flutter's WidgetsBindingObserver in order to achieve Android's onResume/onPause and iOS's viewDidAppear/viewDidDisappear on Flutter.
